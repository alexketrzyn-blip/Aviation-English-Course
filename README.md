# README – Aviation English Course 

##  Overview
This repository contains materials from the **Aviation English course** I designed and delivered.  
The course was created to help learners (e.g., Krzysztof – persona and empathy map included) develop **professional aviation vocabulary** and communication skills required for international aviation contexts, aligned with **ICAO Level 3–4 standards**.

##  Course Objectives
- Build fluency in **aviation-specific English vocabulary**.  
- Practice **radio communication** and **non-routine situations** using ICAO phraseology.  
- Develop skills in **writing technical reports** (e.g., aircraft inspection reports).  
- Strengthen **listening, speaking, reading, and writing** in professional aviation contexts.  
- Prepare learners for **university exams and professional development** in aeronautical engineering and aviation careers.
